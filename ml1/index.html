    <p>
     At the heart of machine learning is pattern recognition. We want computers to find
     patterns in time, patterns in space, patterns within patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
     Once we know the patterns in the world, we can give them names and use
     them to communicate. We can infer the unseen whole from an incomplete part.
     By knowing the ways our patterns change in time — we can begin to predict the future.
    </p>

    <p>
     Consider the hand written digits above. We first learn as children
     the patterns of curves, lines and loops; we draw them with crayons and
     trace them with pencils. Then we learn how these patterns join together
     to form digits. A loop and a stroke for a nine, two loops make an eight.
    </p>

    <p>
     Above is a visualisation of one pattern found by showing a learning program
     pictures of 60,000 handwritten digits.
    </p>

    <p>
     The program has found that digits often have a horizontal top line or bottom line
     but not both. This matches our intuition, 5s and 7s have a top line while some 1s
     and all 2s have a bottom line. There a no digits with both.
    </p>

    <p>
     Our learning program is a crude model of a tiny brain, with only 500 neurons.
     So small that we can simulate it in this web–browser. Facinatingly
     it is still capable of exhibiting many of the features of intelligence.
    </p>

    <p> <!-- FIXME -->
     Below is a live simulation of the 500 neurons in our learning program.
     With each neuron a visualisation of the patterns that activate them.
     Click on a digit or draw a new one to see which patterns are activated.

    <p>
     Input digits are reflected by simulated neural activity.
     Each neuron is sensitive to a specific pattern — if that
     pattern is present on the retina the related neuron
     will become active.
    </p>

    <p>
     The inputs are digested by the brain–model into a collection of patterns.
     The problem of learning is now about wiring the neurons to the retina in the right way.

    <p>
     In this case, each time our program is shown a picture of a digit, It's not
     told what it is. We want it to find its own patterns. This is called
     ‘unsupervised learning’ because there is no benevolent tutor giving
     out the correct answers. Even though the digits are familiar to us, they
     are like an alien language to the program.
    </p>

    <p>
     When using statistics we are often limited to supporting or refuting an
     already know hypothesis. For example, we could calculate the probability
     that some certain symptoms mean you have a particular disease.
     With the right machine learning algorithm, we could find a distinct
     pattern of symptoms that had never been named before and investigate them
     to see if they form a new disease. Or we could find a larger pattern in two
     disparate diseases that leads us to investigate their relationship.
